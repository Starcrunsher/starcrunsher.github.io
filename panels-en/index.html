      I already played quite a few games on stream, and <a href="/spieleliste/">here</a> is a list of everything I played, including links to playlists/videos on my archive youtube channel

      (chat rules)
      <ul>
        <li>no spoilers or backseatgaming, including fake spoilers - just because I think out loud while playing doesn't mean you immediately have to tell me what to do (of course the exception to this is if the stream is tagged with "Backseatgaming Allowed")</li>
        <li>links in chat are okay if they are in some way related to the stream or the current chat topic - otherwise just ask when you want to post a link :3</li>
        <li>I don't want to know many people are watching during my stream, so don't tell how many are there</li>
        <li>AutoMod and CrunshBot are nice enough to filter some things out of chat, and those things include hashtags, uff/oof, the BTTV emote "haHAA", and all kinds of Kappa emotes - you can thank those people that can't use some of those things properly and overuse them so much that I don't want to see them in my chat anymore :3</li>

      (support) <br>
      You already give me the greatest support by just watching and enjoying my stream :3<br>
      If you still wanna support me more than that, and even with money, then you can do that in following ways
      <ul>
        <li>You can subscribe to me here on stream, and even get 5 emotes which you can use everywhere on Twitch then (with a tier 2/3 sub even 6/7 emotes)</li>
        <li>If you wanna give me a small tip, you can do that by clicking <a href="https://www.tipeeestream.com/starcrunsher/tip">here</a></li>
